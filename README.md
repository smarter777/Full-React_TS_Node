React sets the standard for building high-performance client-side web apps. Node.js is a scalable application server that is used in thousands of websites, while GraphQL is becoming the standard way for large websites to provide data and services to their users. Together these technologies, when reinforced with the capabilities of TypeScript, provide a cutting-edge stack for building complete web applications. This book follows a hands-on approach to implementing modern web technologies and the associated methodologies for building full-stack apps. 

This book covers the following exciting features:
* Discover TypeScriptâ€™s most important features and how they can be used to improve code quality and maintainability
* Understand what React Hooks are and how to build React apps using them
* Implement state management for your React app using Redux
* Set up an Express project with TypeScript and GraphQL from scratch
* Build a fully functional online forum app using React and GraphQL
* Add authentication to your web app using Redis
* Save and retrieve data from a Postgres database using TypeORM
